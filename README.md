# Aerocord

Aerocord is a [Vesktop](https://github.com/Vendicated/Vesktop) fork meant for Windows Vista (w/ the extended kernel), Windows 7 and 8. Just like vesktop, it comes with [Vencord](https://github.com/Vendicated/Vencord) pre-installed.
I'm currently deving on Aerocord v3.0.0, source code will be uploaded soon

Credits to [this guy](https://www.deviantart.com/miltonator/art/Discord-Icon-for-Windows-and-MacOS-Skeuomorphism-876399496) for aerocord's logo, I did recolor it with a slightly more vibrand hue of blue

## Building
[Building instructions can be found here](https://github.com/AiekDev/aerocord/blob/main/Building.MD)

After you're done, use win32ss's [supermium-electron](https://github.com/win32ss/supermium-electron/releases) to bring back the windows 7+ support.

## Documentation
[Documentation can be found here, it contains common issues and more](https://github.com/AiekDev/aerocord/blob/main/Documentation.MD)

## Motivation

The official Discord Desktop app has ended support for windows 7 and 8 in march of 2024, and instead of having to use discord on the web (which means being stuck on supermium), I've decided to start forking popular discord clients and backporting them using win32ss's supermium electron. I've did this to ArmCord, Webcord but vesktop stood out as the best option, therefore I made aerocord based off vesktop.
